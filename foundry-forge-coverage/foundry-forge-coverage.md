## Instructions to get line visual coverage in foundry

### 1. Install genhtml

```shell
brew install genhtml
```

### 2. Create a coverage directory in your foundry project

```shell
mkdir coverage
```

### 3. Run the following command

```shell
forge coverage --report lcov && genhtml lcov.info --branch-coverage --output-dir coverage
```

### 4. Open the following file

```shell
coverage/index.html
```

And you'll be able to see a coverage report like what you see at the top of the page.

### No available formula with the name "genhtml". Did you mean ekhtml?

If you get this error, do 

```shell
brew install ekhtml
```

and it will install genhtml.
